# Daily Half Life Image Update
This is the daily Half Life image update, made for the YouTuber [Hazard Time](https://www.youtube.com/@HazardTime).

## Setup
Steps for running this:

1. Make a folder in your "Documents" directory named DailyHL
2. In this folder make two files "days.txt" and "date.txt"
3. In these text files write the last video number and the date of the last video in format `MM-DD-YYYY`
4. Install the font provided named DailyHL (The font was taken directly from Hazard Time's thumbnails)

### And Done!
If you have set up the application correctly it will notify you of the day it is writing on the image and save the image in the current directory.
